# Final Programming Assignment

## Javascript Programming

The goal of the assignment is to implement a 1-page Web application that visualizes information on a google map.

The map shows information about points of interest in a city together with a score of your feeling in this place. For instance, let’s imagine that there is an ice cream shop in the city that you really like. In that case, there will be a marker in that place with a high score. On the other hand, if there is a particular restaurant you don’t like since the food is not good, this restaurant will have a low score.
